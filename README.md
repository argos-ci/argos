# Argos

> Argos is a visual diffing tool made with love.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/argos-ci/argos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/argos-ci/argos)

## The problem solved

- UI tests are **hard to write**.
- Automated testing can't tell you if something doesn't look right. UI **regressions** may go undetected.
- It's hard for **designers** to participate in the code review process.

## Install

```sh
brew install imagemagick graphicsmagick
nvm i
npm i -g yarn
yarn
```
