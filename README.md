# Argos

> Automate visual regression testing.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/argos-ci/argos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/argos-ci/argos)

**Forget about regressions**:
Argos will warn you if any visual regressions are about to be introduced,
so they those don't end-up in production.
We are giving developers high confidence in doing changes so they can quickly iterate.
You can review visual changes in one click as part of your code review process.

**Save time**:
Argos compares screenshots at high speed.
You get a fast feedback.
It comes with a GitHub integration.
It will notify you on pull requests when something might be broken.

**Integrates in your development workflow**:
Argos integrates directly into your test suite and development workflow.
We provide a command line interface streamlining the process.

**Ship pixel-perfect interfaces**:
Argos provides different tools to compare screenshots.
Designers can easily participate in the code review process.

**Testing your open source project is 100% free**:
Seriously. Always. We like to think of it as our way of giving
back to a community that gives us so much as well.

## The problem solved

- UI tests are **hard to write**.
- Automated testing can't tell you if something doesn't look right. UI **regressions** may go undetected.
- It's hard for **designers** to participate in the code review process.
