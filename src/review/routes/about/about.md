## The story

Argos-CI was conceived in 2017 with a simple aim of helping front-end teams quickly iterating.
We automate visual regression testing.
We are giving developers high confidence in doing changes.

This project was developed from our realization as front-end developers:
- At [@doctolib](https://github.com/doctolib), we were sharing components between 4 differents applications to increase code reuse but we had no way to quickly and safely iterate on them.
We were constantly releasing visual regressions.
How can a back-end developer or a new joiner safely iterate on the front-end while
the ones who wrote the code can't?
- At [@Material-UI](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui), we realized that our problem wasn't scoped to [@doctolib](https://github.com/doctolib).
How can we ensure that 500+ contributors can safely submit pull requests without introducing breaking changes while maintainer who are supposed to know the code best can't?

It's 100% open source.
All features are built in the open and can be followed and contributed to on [GitHub](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos).
Each month we process 100k+ screenshots.

## Our Mission
